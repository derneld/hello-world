"Just another repository" is what the 10 minute Git walkthrough had me type...

I'm new to GitHub, and fairly basic in my programming experience. 
I am pursuing a higher degree in statistics brought face-to-face with programming again and I am trying my best to become proficient in R.
I find a lot of discussion on version control, open data, and reproducibility, and decided it would be a good idea to jump on the GitHub bandwagon to get better at those things. 
When I'm not struggling to learn programming, I enjoy playing with my children, working in the yard with my wife, and training for long-distance running events.
